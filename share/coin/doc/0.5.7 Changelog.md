**Should be seen as a work in Progress**

* Updated Versions to:
    * Bitcoin (Version 0.9.1)
    * Namecoin (Version 0.3.50)
    * Litecoin (Version 0.8.7.1)
    * Official Linux Binaries used for each coin. 

* Added Systemd Service Files
    * Daemons can be controlled by
        
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl <command> <coin>d.service
        ```
    * Have scripts in /opt/bin to stop/start services by hand if systemd is not desired. 
* Added ```/opt/bin/<coin>d_getinfo.sh``` scripts (need to be ran as root or coin) to do the get info.

Sorry for the delay guys. Know this isn't much but hopefully it can work for you.

ToDo:

* [ ] Create RPMs For Packages ?
* [ ] Add Binary Checksum to prove source
* [ ] Make Directory structure more standards compliant
* [ ] Add interesting scripts
* [ ] Add other coins
* [ ] Add P2Pool
